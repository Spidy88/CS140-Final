/**
 * reduce(ray, cb, initialValue)
 * ----------
 * Returns a single value created by invoking the callback function for
 * each item in the array. On each iteration the callback is invoked
 * with the current element and result (starts as initialValue).
 *
 * The result of invoking the callback is stored, and used for the next iteration.
 * Once all iterations are complete, reduce returns the final result.
